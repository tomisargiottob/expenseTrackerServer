# Expense-Tracker
An expense tracker is a platform where we will list all our income and expenditures from various sources like salary , freelance , food , travel , medical , education etc to make an analysis about our money. So we can have an idea where we are spending our amount.

# What is an Expense Tracker?
Personal finance management is an important part of peopleâ€™s lives. However, everyone does not have the knowledge or time to manage their finances in a proper manner. And, even if a person has time and knowledge, they do not bother with tracking their expenses as they find it tedious and time-consuming. Now, you donâ€™t have to worry about managing your expenses, as you can get access to an expense tracker that will help in the active management of your finances.

# Objective of this Project :

I'm glad if you want to contribute to this project. 

Please follow [the contribution guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

Thanks a lot


# Getting Started

This project has a server part and a client part. You need to install and start both.

## Install

In the root directory of this project :

1. Install all back-end dependencies

```bash
npm install
```
2. install all front-end dependencies

```bash
npm run client-install
```

## Run

If you're coding into Vscode, you can split your terminal so you can run both scripts and see how it runs ðŸ˜‰

1. Start server in development mode

```bash
npm run server
```
(ðŸ’¡ if you want to start server in production mode run `npm run start`)

2. Start client

```bash
npm run client
```
App is ready and opens in your navigator ðŸŽ‰

## Create React App informations

<details>
<summary>Read all informations about available scripts and learn more about Creat React App applications</summary>
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
